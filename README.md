#snow_data_cleaning

TODO
> Look at new data from Francesco. How do temperature, humidity, etc correlate with flutter? Check CDEC data as well.
* Add in ability to impose priors on state space model parameters
* Check how performance of latent factor model and simple EM algorithm compare on artificial datasets. Which works better, and when?
> Apply SSM-EM model with uninformative prior to estimate noise from summer data, then use that during the season as a prior!
